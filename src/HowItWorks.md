# Pitch Recommendation System - How It Works

## Overview

Our Pitch Recommendation System is designed to help pitchers make strategic decisions by suggesting optimal pitch types and locations based on game situations. The system combines traditional baseball wisdom with data-driven insights to provide recommendations that maximize your chances of success.

## The Recommendation Process

When you use our system to get a pitch recommendation, here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. **Situation Analysis**: The system examines the current game situation, including:
   - The current count (balls and strikes)
   - Batter's handedness (right or left)
   - Pitcher's handedness (right or left)
   - Previous pitches thrown in the at-bat

2. **Rule-Based Scoring**: Traditional baseball strategies are applied, including:
   - Count-based strategies (e.g., being aggressive in pitcher's counts, conservative in hitter's counts)
   - Pattern recognition to avoid becoming predictable
   - Handedness matchup considerations (e.g., breaking balls away from same-sided batters)

3. **Data Integration**: If historical pitch data is available, the system analyzes similar situations from the past

4. **Final Recommendation**: The system combines all insights to suggest the optimal pitch type and location

## How the Rule-Based System Works

The rule-based component applies baseball fundamentals to each situation:

### Count Analysis
The system adjusts recommendations based on the count:
- **Pitcher's Counts (0-2, 1-2)**: Suggests "chase" pitches like breaking balls low and away
- **Hitter's Counts (3-0, 3-1)**: Recommends more conservative pitches that are likely to be strikes
- **Even Counts (1-1, 2-2)**: Balances strikeout potential with avoiding walks
- **First Pitch (0-0)**: Focuses on getting ahead in the count

### Pattern Recognition
The system tracks patterns to keep batters guessing:
- Avoids throwing the same pitch type more than twice in a row
- Recommends changing locations to prevent batters from anticipating the next pitch
- Suggests complementary pitch sequences (e.g., fastball inside followed by breaking ball away)

### Handedness Matchups
Different strategies are applied based on the pitcher-batter handedness matchup:
- **Same-Side Matchups** (righty vs. righty or lefty vs. lefty): Emphasizes breaking balls away from the batter
- **Opposite-Side Matchups**: Adjusts recommendations based on which breaking pitches are most effective

## How Historical Data Enhances Recommendations

When historical pitch data is uploaded to the system, the recommendation process becomes even more powerful:

### Data Analysis Process
1. The system searches for similar situations in the historical database
2. It analyzes which pitches were most successful in those situations
3. Success rates for each pitch type and location are calculated
4. These insights are weighted and integrated with the rule-based recommendations

### The Data Advantage
With historical data, the system can:
- Identify which pitches have historically been most effective in specific counts
- Recognize pitcher-specific strengths that may not follow traditional patterns
- Show you which professional pitchers have used similar approaches successfully
- Provide data-driven insights explaining why certain recommendations are made

### Example Insights
The system might tell you things like:
- "Sliders have a 75% success rate in this situation"
- "Gerrit Cole has had success with this pitch selection"
- "Fastballs up in the zone are historically effective with two strikes against left-handed batters"

## Recommendation Balancing

The final recommendation balances traditional baseball wisdom with data-driven insights:
- By default, the system gives stronger weight (80%) to data-driven insights when historical data is available
- When little historical data exists, the system relies more heavily on rule-based recommendations
- As more data becomes available, data-driven insights carry even more weight
- You can adjust how much the system prioritizes historical data vs. traditional strategy

## Getting the Most from the System

To maximize the effectiveness of the pitch recommendation system:
1. Upload relevant historical pitch data when available
2. Track the success of recommendations to build your own dataset
3. Use the insights section to understand the reasoning behind recommendations
4. Remember that the system is a decision support tool - your knowledge of the specific game situation is always valuable

### Data Requirements
The system only needs a minimum of 3 data points for a specific situation to begin generating data-driven recommendations. This means:
- Even with a small dataset, you'll start seeing data-influenced recommendations quickly
- More data still leads to more reliable insights, but the barrier to entry is low
- The system will clearly indicate when it's using historical data in its decision-making process

By combining your baseball expertise with our data-enhanced recommendation system, you'll have a powerful tool for making optimal pitching decisions in any situation.
